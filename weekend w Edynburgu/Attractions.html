				<a name="castle"></a><img src=img/ediCastle1.jpg style="width:400px; margin-right:10px; float:left; margin-top:25px;"/><a href="https://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/" target="_blank">
				<h3>Edinburgh Castle</h3></a> <br>is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, from its position on the Castle Rock. Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued to be a royal residence until 1633. From the 15th century the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half. As one of the most <img src=img/edi6v3.jpg style="width:400px; margin-top:10px; margin-left:10px; float: right;"/>important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year-old history, giving it a claim to having been "the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world"

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calton_Hill" target="_blank"><h3>Calton Hill</h3></a> <br> is a hill in central Edinburgh, Scotland, situated beyond the east end of Princes Street and included in the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site. Views of, and from, the hill are often used in photographs and paintings of the city.<br><br><img src=img/slider/edi1.jpg style="width:975px; margin-right:10px; clear:both;"/>
				
				<a name="Arthurs_Seat">
				<br><br><br><br>
				<img src=img/aSeat1.jpg style="width:400px; margin-left:10px; float:right;"/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_Seat" target="_blank"><h3>Arthur's Seat</h3></a></a>is the main peak of the group of hills in Edinburgh, Scotland which form most of Holyrood Park, described by Robert Louis Stevenson as "a hill for magnitude, a mountain in virtue of its bold design". It is situated just to the east of the city centre, about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the east of Edinburgh Castle. The hill rises above the city to a height of 250.5 m (822 ft), provides excellent panoramic views of the city and beyond, is relatively easy to climb, and is popular for hillwalking. Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above Dunsapie Loch. At a spur of the hill, Salisbury Crags has historically been a rock climbing venue with routes of various degrees of difficulty; however due to hazards rock climbing is now restricted to the South Quarry and a free permit is required.

				<img src=img/IMG_1508.jpg style="width:400px; margin-right:10px; float:left;"/><a href="https://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/?item_id=" target="_blank"><h3>Museum of Scotland</h3><a name="Museum_of_Scotland"></a>The National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland, was formed in 2006 with the merger of the new Museum of Scotland, with collections relating to Scottish antiquities, culture and history, and the adjacent Royal Museum (so renamed in 1995), with collections covering science and technology, natural history, and world cultures. The two connected buildings stand beside each other on Chambers Street, by the intersection with the George IV Bridge, in central Edinburgh. The museum is part of National Museums Scotland. Admission is free.
				<br>
				The two buildings retain distinctive characters: the Museum of Scotland is housed in a modern building opened in 1998, while the former Royal Museum building was begun in 1861, and partially opened in 1866, with a Victorian Venetian Renaissance facade and a grand central hall of cast iron construction that rises the full height of the building. This building underwent a major refurbishment and reopened on 29 July 2011 after a three-year, Â£47 million project to restore and extend the building led by Gareth Hoskins Architects along with the concurrent redesign of the exhibitions by Ralph Appelbaum Associates
